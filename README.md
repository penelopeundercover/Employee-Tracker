# Employee-Tracker

##Description
The purpose of this CLI application is to maintain a running list of employees within a company. The table displays an employee's name, id, job title, salary, and manager(if applicable). It's designed to be updated as needed.In building this, I've gotten a more solid grip on using SQL.
